In September of 2023 I realized I was enjoyng programming and studying a variety of Computer Science material quite a lot. However, one of the drawbacks of having so much free and available material available online, is that, choosing what to study, and when, provides a considerable challenge to anyone unfamiliar with the field. I was lucky to have started with two awesome courses, Python for Everyone from the University of Michigan (offered on Coursera) and CS50 by Harvard University (Offered on EdX). I was hooked and wanted more. 

Later that year I found the Open Source Society Universty's (OSSU) curriculum for Computer Science. Here is how OSSU describes this curriculum 


>The OSSU curriculum is a complete education in computer science using online materials. It's not merely for career training or professional development. It's for those who want a proper, well-rounded grounding in concepts fundamental to all computing disciplines, and for those who have the discipline, will, and (most importantly!) good habits to obtain this education largely on their own [...]. It is designed according to the degree requirements of undergraduate computer science majors, minus general education (non-CS) requirements, as it is assumed most of the people following this curriculum are already educated outside the field of CS.


The currriculum is also designed to match the specifications by the Joint Task Force on Computing Curricula
Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).

Here are the courses grouped by area of study
