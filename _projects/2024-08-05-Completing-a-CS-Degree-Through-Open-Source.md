In September 2023, I realized I was enjoying programming and studying a variety of computer science material quite a lot. However, one of the drawbacks of having so much free and available material online is that choosing what to study, and when, poses a considerable challenge for anyone unfamiliar with the field. I was fortunate to have started with two excellent courses: *Python for Everybody* from the University of Michigan (offered on Coursera) and *CS50* by Harvard University (offered on EdX). I was hooked and wanted more.

Later that year, I discovered the Open Source Society University's (OSSU) curriculum for Computer Science. Here's how OSSU describes this curriculum:

> The OSSU curriculum is a complete education in computer science using online materials. It's not merely for career training or professional development. It's for those who want a proper, well-rounded grounding in concepts fundamental to all computing disciplines, and for those who have the discipline, will, and (most importantly!) good habits to obtain this education largely on their own [...]. It is designed according to the degree requirements of undergraduate computer science majors, minus general education (non-CS) requirements, as it is assumed most of the people following this curriculum are already educated outside the field of CS.

The curriculum is also designed to match the specifications by the Joint Task Force on Computing Curricula of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).

Although the lecture material for every suggested resource is free (one of the requirements to be included by OSSU), I found that having access to grading software and quizzes for some of these courses helped me stay on track and meet learning standards. In a few cases, I chose different courses that covered similar topics, mainly because of easier access to grading materials and assignments.

Here are the courses grouped by area of study

## Advanced CS

After completing every course above, OSSU recommends that students choose a subset of courses based on interest and take every course within that subset. I am currently interested in three of the main areas but have not currently started courses in any of them. The areas are: Advanced Programming, Advanced Systems, and Advanced Theory.  

## Electives

These are not mandatory or listed by OSSU but they seemed interesting and were informative to me.
