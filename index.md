Welcome to my website, I'm Lucas, a software developer, violinist, and running enthusiast. Here, you'll find an overview of my computer science projects (written in a less technical language than my GitHub READMEs) and personal updates in the blog section. Whether you’re here to check out my projects, read about my adventures, or simply connect, I hope you find something that inspires you.

## Explore My Site:
- **[Projects](projects/):** Dive into short summaries of the programming and computer science projects I’ve worked on.
- **[Blog](blog/):** Read personal updates mostly unrelated to programming.
- **[About](about/):** Learn more about my background, interests, and the journey that brought me here.
- **[Contact](contact/):** Get in touch.

Thank you for visiting, and I hope you enjoy your stay!
