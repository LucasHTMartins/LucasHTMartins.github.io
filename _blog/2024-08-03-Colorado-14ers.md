A 14er is a mountain peak that exceeds 14,000ft of elevation. The US is home to 96 such peaks and Colorado has about 53 (depending on how they get counted). Over the past few years I've had the opportunity to climb a few of them, this page will keep an archive of these peaks and a few of my favorite pictures!

Current list of peaks over 14.000ft climbed in Colorado:

- Mt. Elbert
- Quandry Pead
- Mt. Democrat
- Mt. Cameron
- Mt. Lincoln
- Mt. Bross
- Mt. Sherman
- Mt. Antero
- Mt. Shavano
- Tabeguache Peak
- Mt. Princeton
- Mt. Yale
- San Luis Peak
- Challenger Point
