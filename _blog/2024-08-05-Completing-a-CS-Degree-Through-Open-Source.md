In August 2023, I realized I was enjoying my programming hobby quite a lot and decided to take my interest further. As anyone who has looked into the area could agree, there is so much material available online, complete books, articles, tutorials, courses, guides, and more. However, one of the drawbacks of having so much free and available material is that choosing what to study, and when, poses a considerable challenge for anyone unfamiliar with the field as I was back then. I was fortunate to have started with two excellent courses: *Python for Everybody* from the University of Michigan (offered on Coursera) and *CS50* by Harvard University (offered on EdX) but was not certain where to go next. Having had a formal education in another field, I was skeptical of bootcamps and cautious of not falling prey to "learn X/Y/Z in under 30 minutes" type guides.

Thankfully, I quickly found out about a promising curriculum proposed by the Open Source Society University (OSSU) later that year. Here's how OSSU describes this curriculum:

> The OSSU curriculum is a complete education in computer science using online materials. It's not merely for career training or professional development. It's for those who want a proper, well-rounded grounding in concepts fundamental to all computing disciplines, and for those who have the discipline, will, and (most importantly!) good habits to obtain this education largely on their own [...]. It is designed according to the degree requirements of undergraduate computer science majors, minus general education (non-CS) requirements, as it is assumed most of the people following this curriculum are already educated outside the field of CS.

The curriculum is also designed to match the specifications by the Joint Task Force on Computing Curricula of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).

Although the lecture materials for every suggested resources are free (one of the requirements to be included by OSSU), I found that having access to grading software and quizzes for some of these courses helped me stay on track and meet learning standards. In a few cases, I chose different courses that covered similar topics, mainly because of easier access to grading materials and assignments.

Here are the courses grouped by area of study

## Advanced CS

After completing the courses above, OSSU recommends that students choose a specialization based on interest and take every course within that subset. I am currently interested in the Advanced Programming and Advanced Systems courses and am planning to complete both tracks.
